#social-sign-in

__social-sign-in__ is a demo implementation of AddThis's Social Sign In using PHP's CodeIgniter framework on a MySQL backend. 

If you don't have a registration system or application to make use of social sign in or user information, you can use the files in this sample app to set up a basic registration system.

###What's included in the example?###

#### Sign in page ###
A page with standard login form as well as AddThis Sign In Buttons. Registered users can also sign in with username and password, and connect a social media account later.

#### Registration page ###
A page with a standard registration form. Users can register here and connect their social media account later.

#### Dashboard page ###
A generic page to display social data for a single user. It automatically displays the user's profile URL, picture, name, locale, and the service used to sign in.

#### MySQL Database ###
A database with two tables:users and user_social_login. Stores login and signature details for all registered users.

All the service specific fields are listed in the implementation doc.
